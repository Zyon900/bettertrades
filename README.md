# BetterTrades

This mod is intended to make Villager trades more meaningful and less grindy.

## Functionality

- Reroll trades when villager sleeps.
- Reroll trades when villager restocks. (Only trades that are used up - configurable in config)
- Filled Maps can only be rerolled if the trade is used up and needs to be restocked.

## Configurabilty

- Rerolling can be individually turned on/off and chances can be adjusted in bettertrades-common.toml
